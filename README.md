# secure-pasword-reset
Implementing a secure password reset mechanism that uses one-time passwords (OTP) and public-key cryptography algorithms to prevent unauthorized access is a complex task, but here are the general steps you can follow to implement this mechanism in Python:

Generate Public and Private Keys:

To implement a public-key cryptography algorithm, you first need to generate a public and private key pair. You can use a library such as PyCryptodome to generate the keys.

Create OTP:

You can use a library such as PyOTP to generate a one-time password (OTP) for the user.

Encrypt the OTP:

Once the OTP is generated, you can encrypt it using the user's public key. You can use a library such as PyCryptodome to perform the encryption.

Store the Encrypted OTP:

Store the encrypted OTP and the user's email or phone number in a database for future reference.

Send OTP to the user:

You can use a library such as Twilio or SendGrid to send the encrypted OTP to the user's email or phone number.

Decrypt the OTP:

When the user enters the OTP, retrieve the encrypted OTP from the database and decrypt it using the user's private key.

Verify the OTP:

Compare the decrypted OTP with the OTP entered by the user. If they match, allow the user to reset their password.
